# Be-safe
It is an app which can be used to register complaints from android and ios app. The main difference between dialling 101 and using our app in emergency is , you might waste your time reaching to your nearest police station but using our app, you can register your complaint and it will reach to the nearest police station. Women's can feel safe as in emergency police can reach out to them through their location. If not emergency then registered complaint can be tracked through actions performed by both victim and police department. This app is an attempt to improve the current loophole of Indian government in Crime Investigation.
